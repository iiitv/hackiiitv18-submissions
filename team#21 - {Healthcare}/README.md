##What does this Program do?
*  Our program aims to make talking about mental health a day-to-day topic, negating the stigma associated with it. It aims to be as readily accessible in assessing mental health through mobile apps as are pregnancy sticks for pregnancy.


### How does it work?

  1. We start by taking input from the user in the form of answers to a standardised, reliable depression test (**_The Goldberg Test_**) and conveying to the user the severity of their depression.
  2. Based on the result of the test (6 categories), the program will suggest some steps, a sort of **Mental First Aid**, for some immediate relief.
  3. The current suggestions include :
     * Scientifically designed music, 'Weightless' by Marconi Union, to reduce blood pressure, heart rate, etc. accesible from inside the app.
     * Doable exercises, for endorphin release, through graphic instructions.
     * For higher severities, we refer them to sites like [7cups](https://www.7cups.com/), which offer both free and paid therapy, and/or to go for professional therapy.

###Business Model/Future Plans:
  1. We plan to give every user an account. A dashboard in their profile will indicate their mental state based on statistical analysis of his recent to previous test scores.
  2. In his profile, we will take many inputs. By asking for their locality, a locality database hence created by us will be used to give to professional therapists to conduct seminars, workshops in these areas and a commission for us from the patients that join them through these. This helps everyone including us, the doctor, and the patient.
  3. A separate section of the app will be developed for different age groups of females, so that they can:
     - Adult women can report harassment, abuse, domestic violence, rape, etc.
     - Teenage girls can report harassment, eve-teasing (with locality so that other girls be prepared with mace, pepper spray, friends in those areas), molestation, rape, etc.
  4. Similar separate sections for Soldiers (__PTSD__), those who have lost any relative recently, people with terminal illness, etc. Using a paid version of the app, these people can connect amongst themselves for self-help groups, inter-patient therapy, support groups, etc.
  5. A page with all mental-health helplines at one place, with calling a button away. Business helplines would need to give commision for each call recieved through the app.
